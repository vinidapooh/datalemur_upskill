Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, 
write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's
first and last post.

posts Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
post_id	integer
post_content	text
post_date	timestamp
posts 

Example Input:
user_id	post_id	post_content	post_date
151652	599415	Need a hug	07/10/2021 12:00:00
661093	624356	Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. Another day that's gonna fly by. I miss my girlfriend	07/29/2021 13:00:00
004239	784254	Happy 4th of July!	07/04/2021 11:00:00
661093	442560	Just going to cry myself to sleep after watching Marley and Me.	07/08/2021 14:00:00
151652	111766	I'm so done with covid - need travelling ASAP!	07/12/2021 19:00:00


Example Output:
user_id	days_between
151652	2
661093	21


SOLUTION:

SELECT 
	user_id, 
    MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE EXTRACT(year from post_date::DATE) = 2021 
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(post_id)>1;
